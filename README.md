# ETR Blockchain

## Description

ETR Blockchain is a lightweight, decentralized cryptocurrency and blockchain network designed to be accessible for anyone with a computer or smartphone. ETR aims to provide faster transaction speeds and lower costs compared to Bitcoin, while maintaining high security standards. The project is written in Python, utilizing a simplified Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism with additional lightweight consensus features.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Network**: Operates without a central authority, with nodes that can run on regular computers and smartphones.
- **Faster Transactions**: Designed to offer quicker transaction processing and confirmation times compared to Bitcoin.
- **Lower Fees**: Aims to provide more affordable transaction fees.
- **Simplified Proof of Work**: Uses a PoW consensus mechanism where miners solve puzzles with hashes starting with 5-6 zeros.
- **Pruning**: Implements transaction pruning to maintain a lightweight ledger, keeping only the last 500MB of blocks.
- **Scalable**: Capable of scaling to support a large number of nodes and users.
- **Reward Mechanism**: Miners are rewarded with 25 ETR per block, with a halving mechanism until the cap of 21.5 million ETR coins is reached.
